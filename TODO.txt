Last thing done: I finished setting up venv, just started on installing/setting up github (but made no progress yet)


- [] Define standards
- [] Figure out process for mapping LED positions in 2D
- [] Display patterns on 2D LEDs
- [] Figure out process for mapping LED positions in 3D
- [] Display patterns on 3D LEDs
- [] Figure out how to error correct positions in 3D (if needed?)
- [] Figure out how to import patterns from CSV format defined in "LED Christmas Tree Standards"
- [] Write a web interface to run the system (built in timer functionality, predefined list of patterns to run, etc)
